WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[0]_AND_15_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[1]_AND_13_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[2]_AND_11_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin.
   This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of
   data into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[3]_AND_9_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[4]_AND_7_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[5]_AND_5_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data
   into the flip-flop.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   hijacker1/SPI_S1/css_dat_o[6]_AND_3_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This
   is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data

INFO:PhysDesignRules:1861 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp
   Inst_SysCon/Inst_dcm_fixed/dcm_sp_inst, consult the device Data Sheet.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2410 - This design is using one or more 9K Block RAMs
   (RAMB8BWER).  9K Block RAM initialization data, both user defined and
   default, may be incorrect and should not be used.  For more information,
   please reference Xilinx Answer Record 39999.
DRC detected 0 errors and 8 warnings.  Please see the previously displayed
individual error or warning messages for more details.
