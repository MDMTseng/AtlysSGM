<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3159" delta="old" >The DCM, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">Inst_SysCon/Inst_dcm_recfg/dcm_clkgen_inst</arg>, has the attribute DFS_OSCILLATOR_MODE not set to PHASE_FREQ_LOCK. No phase relationship exists between the input clock and CLKFX or CLKFX180 outputs of this DCM. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.
</msg>

<msg type="warning" file="Timing" num="3402" delta="old" >The Clock Modifying COMP, <arg fmt="%s" index="1">Inst_SysCon/Inst_dcm_fixed/dcm_sp_inst</arg>, has the attribute CLK_FEEDBACK set to NONE.  No phase relationship exists between the input and output clocks of this Clock Modifying COMP. Data paths between these clock domains must be constrained using FROM/TO constraints.

<msg type="warning" file="Par" num="468" delta="old" >Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.

Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select &quot;Post-Place &amp;
Route Static Timing Report&quot;). Go to the failing constraint(s) and evaluate the failing paths for each constraint.

Try the Design Goal and Strategies for Timing Performance(In ISE select Project -&gt; Design Goals &amp; Strategies) to ensure the best options are set in the tools for timing closure.

<msg type="info" file="Timing" num="2761" delta="old" >N/A entries in the Constraints List may indicate that the constraint is not analyzed due to the following: No paths covered by this constraint; Other constraints intersect with this constraint; or This constraint was disabled by a Path Tracing Control. Please run the Timespec Interaction Report (TSI) via command line (trce tsi) or Timing Analyzer GUI.</msg>
